# SEMU

SEMU is Slow EMUlator based on QEMU, which is written in Python.  
QEMU is written in C. I think it is to be quick.  
In the other hand, Fabrice Bellard who is parent of QEMU wrote for linux emulator with javascript.
And I can use that. It isn't too slow.  

I wonder how quick it is if QEMU is written in python.  
So, I tried to import QEMU in python world.  
And it is to improve my skill of python and sim/emuulator.  
But, it won't be QEMU. I think it will be slow.  
'cause my python skill is too low.  

So, I named this project "SEMU".  
It will be slow but we can use an emulator wherever python works.
